## How To Run This App Locally

```
# install
npm i

# run (mqke sure you're on the dev branch for local dev)
git checkout dev
npm run vercel dev
```

## Thought Process

- I really want this job. <b>Hit a home run.</b>
- Identify the most challenging parts of the app. <b>Have a conversation with ChatGPT to narrow down the best solutions</b>
  - Challenges:
    - Emails
    - Deployment

## Risks

- Making this repo public. Deploying a public repo is much more well supported for a small project like this.
- Choosing SolidJS. It was a good choice in the end.

## Tech Stack

- I love React... but SolidJS is better & simpler.
  - Knowledge transfer to SolidJS is a piece of cake, plus the momentum of the Solid community is... solid.
  - Amazing! SolidJS has [vercel support](https://docs.solidjs.com/guides/how-to-guides/deployment/deploying-to-vercel)
