# invoice code challenge

## Demos

- _unstyled_
- _polished_

## How To Run This App

- _instructions_

## Thought Process

- I really want this job. <b>Hit a home run.</b>
- Identify the most challenging parts of the app. <b>Have a conversation with ChatGPT to narrow down the best solutions</b>
  - Challenges:
    - Emails
    - Deployment
- Make an unstyled, boring version of the app that functions correctly
- Package the app in a thematic, polished way--something that Karthik would be happy to put on his app dinner menu at his Michelin star app restaurant
  - He didn't tell me if he was a Trekky or a Jedi.. do both I guess!
  - Focus on the webapp version. Not enough time to test mobile.

## Risky Choices

- Making this repo public. <b>It's too much of a limiting factor to deploy a private repo for a code challenge.</b>
- Choosing SolidJS over React. <b>SolidJS is better than React in every way. Choosing React honestly seems like a bad business decision without strong arguments for using it besides its overwhelming market share.</b>

## Time Breakdown

  - 30 minutes chat with Karthik
  - 15 miuntes planning. <b>Measure twice, cut once.</b>
