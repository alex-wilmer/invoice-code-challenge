## How To Run This App

- _instructions_

## Thought Process

- I really want this job. <b>Hit a home run.</b>
- Identify the most challenging parts of the app. <b>Have a conversation with ChatGPT to narrow down the best solutions</b>
  - Challenges:
    - Emails
    - Deployment
- Make an untstyled, boring version of the app that functions correctly
- Package the app in a thematic, polished way--something that Karthik would be happy to put on his app dinner menu at his Michelin star app restaurant
  - He didn't tell me if he was a Trekky or a Jedi.. do both I guess!
  - Focus on the webapp version. Not enough time to test mobile.

## Tech Stack

- I love React... but SolidJS is better & simpler.
  - Knowledge transfer to SolidJS is a piece of cake, plus the momentum of the Solid community is... solid.
  - Amazing! SolidJS has [vercel support](https://docs.solidjs.com/guides/how-to-guides/deployment/deploying-to-vercel)
